# quadrotor-dynamics
This repository demonstrates the position of a quadrotor given its specific conditions that can be altered to view different types of behaviors. 
# Spring-Mass-Damper System
The spring-mass-damper system is a classic linear model used to demonstrate fundamental control principles. In the code the Equation of Motion for this particular system is derived from Newton's Second Law and Hooke's Law. The code allows for adjustments of the control gains to observe how a system transitions from an unstable, oscillating state to stable, and a damped response. 
# 2D Quadrotor Model
This simulation extends the concepts to a more realistic nonlinear system. It models a quadrotor's motion in a two dimensional plane, showing the relationship between thrust and torque and the vehicle's position. It reveals the challenges of controlling a nonlinear system, demonstrating why UAVs require sophisticated, well-tuned controllers.
